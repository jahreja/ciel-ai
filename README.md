# Ciel AI - A DCGAN

This DCGAN was developed with the help of Alec Radford's 2016 paper Unsupervised Representation Learning with Deep Convolutional Generative Adversarial Networks.
It uses a dataset of around 500 photographs of the sky from a research centre in Germany, and produces displays of photographs resembling the sky. 

I have struggled to upload the full repo to Github due to /torch file size issues, but I am in the process of fixing this.
